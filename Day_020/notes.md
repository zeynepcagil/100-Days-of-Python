# 🐍 100 Days of Code – Day 20: Snake Game (Part 1)

## 🎯 Goal
- Create the foundation of the Snake Game using Python's `turtle` module.
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a `Snake` class.
- Make the snake move forward and allow keyboard control.

## 🛠️ What I Did
- Built a `Snake` class with 3 starting segments.
- Implemented a `move()` method so each segment follows the one in front.
- Set up the game screen (`setup()`, `bgcolor()`, `title()`, `tracer(0)`).
- Added keyboard event listeners (`screen.listen()`, `screen.onkey()`) for controlling the snake with arrow keys.

## ✅ Outcome
- Practiced OOP with the `turtle` graphics module.
- Understood animation and coordinate movement.
- Implemented a game loop (`while game_is_on:`) to keep the snake moving continuously.
